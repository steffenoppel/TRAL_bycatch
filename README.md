# TRAL_bycatch
Analysis of extrapolated bycatch numbers of Tristan Albatross on population growth rate.
This work was commissioned by Ross Wanless based on newly available total bycatch extrapolations of Tristan Albatrosses in 2016. The goal is to understand whether the amount of birds killed by longliners in a given year has an effect on population growth rate.

The analysis replicates the work published in TRAL_IPM (Oppel et al. 2022), but instead of projecting population growth under different scenarios of chick predation (mouse eradication), the projections will assume that mouse predation continues and explore different scenarios of fisheries mortality.
